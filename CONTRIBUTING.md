## Documentation

### Wording
* User centric
  * Imagine you are speaking to a beginner, helping him to achieve a simple useful task.
  * Prefer popular terms over technicaly correct ones
  * Titles should be achievements (i.e. "Upload files")
* Short sentences
* Focused and precise
  * Explain one thing at a time.
  * Do not explain related topics but provide a link to the page where they are being explained. 
* Add links whenever possible. 

### Examples
* Every example should be executable without modification
  * Do not use fake ids (i.e. "12345")
  * Avoid template-like placeholders (i.e. "/<your-folder>/index.html")
* Isomorphic code should be presented in generic examples.
* Examples for specific environments should be declared as such explicitly.
* Distinguish secret from publishable keys and always explicitly declare them as such.
